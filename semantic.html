                    <h2>WWF History</h2>
                    <p>
                        The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international
                        organization working on issues regarding the
                        conservation, research and restoration of the
                        environment, formerly named the World Wildlife Fund. WWF
                        was founded in 1961.

                    <h2>WWF's Symbol</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Panda has become the symbol of WWF. The well-known
                        panda logo of WWF originated from a panda named Chi Chi
                        that was transferred from the Beijing Zoo to the London
                        Zoo in the same year of the establishment of WWF.
